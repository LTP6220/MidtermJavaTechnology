This Spring Boot application incorporates various software development principles, patterns, and practices, exemplifying:

1/ Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: Embracing the MVC design pattern, the application segregates into Model, View, and Controller components. This division streamlines codebase maintenance, fostering adaptability and scalability.

2/ Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Leveraging Hibernate, an ORM framework, the app facilitates the translation of Java objects into relational database tables. This abstraction mitigates the intricacies associated with melding object-oriented programming and relational databases.

3/ Dependency Injection (DI): Harnessing Spring Framework's DI capabilities, the application seamlessly injects dependencies into classes. This diminishes inter-component coupling, promoting modular and easily maintainable code.

4/ Repository Pattern: Employing a repository layer, the app abstracts data access logic from the service layer. This segregation of concerns simplifies unit testing and enhances maintainability.
